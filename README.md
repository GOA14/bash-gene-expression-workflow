# Bash-based Gene Expression Workflow

## Overview
This project demonstrates a beginner-friendly Bash workflow for exploring gene expression datasets. 
The goal is to show how simple Linux tools can be used to understand the structure and basic properties of biological data in a reproducible way.

## Project Focus
- Gene expression data
- Linux/Bash workflows
- Reproducibility and accessibility
- Beginner-friendly bioinformatics training

## Case Studies
This workflow is demonstrated using multiple case studies:
- Antibiotic resistance
- Malaria
- Cancer

The same workflow is applied across datasets to demonstrate generalizability.

## Tools Used
- Bash
- Linux command-line utilities (`wc`, `head`, `grep`, `awk`)

## Status
Project in progress.
